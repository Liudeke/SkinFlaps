1) Incision Tin/out to pre-existing incision begin/end
2) Change History mechanism and program motif to deterministic
3) Rewrite bcc tet embed program using a centroid motif.
4) Deep cut open begin/end change to plane extension rather than bilinear extrapolation.
5) Bug hunt mechanism for failed deep cuts.
6) More consistent response and recovery from throws.
